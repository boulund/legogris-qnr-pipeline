Changelog
=========

2012-07-17  Fredrik Boulund, version 0.8067 beta

	* Several small fixes.
	* Introduced new --minlength and --minscore command line options.
	* Changed default parameter values of k, m, d, and minlength to;
	  0.7778, -7.89, 150.64, 25, respectively.

2012-05-02  Fredrik Boulund, version 0.8055 beta

	* Updated classification function default parameters according to new PSO
	  based optimization.

2012-02-10  Fredrik Boulund, version 0.7055 beta

	* Small fixes here and there, minor things.

2011-07-18  Fredrik Boulund, version 0.7043 beta

	* Fixed two or three very low key bugs where parsing of the hmmsearch
	  output would not work as intended when HMMER found a hit above inclusion
	  threshold that contained no domains above inclusion threshold.

2011-07-13  Fredrik Boulund, version 0.7042 beta

	* Fixed a nasty hidden bug where a fragment would be classified twice with
	  different apparent sequence length giving different results, causing an 
	  error.
	* Fixed a bug where the pipeline would spew out errors trying to retrieve
	  sequences from a database without cdbfasta index (*.cidx). Now it skips
	  all sequences that should be retrieved from such databases.

2011-07-12  Fredrik Boulund, version 0.7030 beta

	* Fixed low-profile bug with parsing of hmmsearch aligned domains where,
	  when extending a match, sometimes it would retrieve too much of the source
	  sequence.
	* Fixed obscure bug where lowscoring domains were never subjected to
	  classification function
	* Pipeline can now retrieve full-length sequences from source database file
	  using cdbfasta/cdbyank.
	* Added option (-A) to run only the alignment step. Trying to run all steps
	  using their "only"-option (-HELA) will run the entire pipeline.
	* Added summary statistics to the pipeline output after successful complete
	  run.
	* Fixed an error related to parsing of HMMER;hmmsearch output.
	* Modified the name of clusterfiles, removed unnecessary "malign".
	* Changed so that MAFFT decides what algorithm to use for alignment since
	  forcing MAFFT to use 'linsi' made the pipeline stop in some cases.
	* Added log-messages when skipping parts of the pipeline.
	* Added option to extract extended parts of sequences (--extendleft and 
	  --extendright) using cdbfasta/cdbyank.
	* Hardcoded a minimum fragment length of 10 amino acids because blastclust
	  can't handle to cluster very short fragments, this is no problem since the
	  power at such short fragment lengths is too low to be useful anyway.
	* Fixed so that the pipeline no longer overwrites old log output.
	* Fixed robustness issues with MAFFT and blastclust.
	* Fixed pipeline crash if the pipeline found no model to use.
	* Pipeline now flushes the log output more often at strategic positions.
	* 73 minor syntactical and error handling fixes.
	* Added settings display in log output.
	* Added classification function feature.
	* Created an "advanced options" grouping in the help listing.
	* Fixed issue with number of sequences parsed from hmmsearch output not
	  being logged properly.
	* Logfile is no longer created if pipeline is run without arguments.
	* Logfile now prints date and time.
	* fluff.py;parse_hmmsearch can now handle when there are no hits.
	* Fixed bug with blastclust output diagnostic text not showing up in log.
	* Fixed logfile printing to disk.
	* Fixed bug with origin source marking of sequences when the database 
	  filename contains no dots.
	* Fixed bug with a FASTA formatting.
	* Improved the origin source marking of sequences (two levels).

2010-07-26  Fredrik Boulund, version 0.6389 beta

	* First release.
