Welcome to SofT's documentation!
================================
This is the documentation for the Python software package `SofT` (Series of Tubes), a bioinformatics pipeline framework for searching large genomic datasets for genes of interest. Implementatios for fluoroquinolone antibiotic resistance genes and beta-lactamases are included.

The included qnr pipeline is an implementation of the method described in the paper Boulund et al.: A novel method to discover fluoroquinolone antibiotic resistance (qnr) genes in fragmented nucleotide sequences. BMC Genomics 2012 13:695. The framework is an attempt to further generalize and extend the method.
