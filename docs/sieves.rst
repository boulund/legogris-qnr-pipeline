Sieves
======

These are the sieves that are shipped with SofT. Together they fit very well for identifying and assembling putative genes against a HMMER model.
Each module exports the Sieve subclass as the `sieve` attribute, which makes it convennient to pass the entire module to the run-methods in `sieve`.
